E-Sektionens Teletekniska Avdelning (ETA) is an Student Union Society under the [Chalmers Student Union](https://chalmersstudentkar.se/) that runs a fully student-driven electronics laboratory at Chalmers University of Technology open to join for all members of the Chalmers Student Union. Our purpose is to give students the means to apply their knowledge in electronics. We offer our members access to electronic instruments, a mechanical workshop, 3D-printers, in house PCB-process as well as our antenna park. The ham-radio station stationed at ETA has call sign SK6AB.

Originally founded in 1935 as an amateur radio club by Chalmers students in cooperation with the university. Throughout the years ETA’s focus has shifted towards general electronics alongside the progress of the electronics industry. Today ETA provides the equipment necessary for a broad range of projects, specializing in electronics hardware. Each year ETA arranges an electronics [auction]({{<ref "/auction">}}).
